# calculator
This project is to build a calculator web pad using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

The calculator contains functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, including 'add', 'subtract', ,'multiply' & 'divide'.
There is a function 'operate' that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
There is a HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.
There is also a “clear” button.
Users are able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = yields 42. The calculator will not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. If you enter a number then an operator and another number that calculation will be displayed if your next input is an operator. The result of the calculation will be used as the first number in your new calculation.
Pressing 'clear' will wipe out any existing data. 
An error message will be displayed if you attempt to divide by 0.
Answers with long decimals are rounded so that they don’t overflow the screen.
Decimal points can only be typed in once
There is  a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
